# Help to AsciiArtify

To help the AsciiArtify startup team prepare a comparative analysis of three tools for deploying Kubernetes clusters in a local environment - minikube, kind, and k3d - the following action plan is proposed:

## 1. Introduction

**Description of tools and their purpose**
* **minikube:** A local Kubernetes system that allows you to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on a single computer. A convenient option for development and testing.
* **kind:** A tool that allows you to create local Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers. It is used for testing.
* **k3d:** A tool for creating local Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers using the Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE). Fast and easy to use.

## 2. Features
